## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard that would allow the user to search and view current and forecasted weather for a given city name. The dashboard has a search input where users can search for targeted cities and save for future reference. The weather display shows weather icons and data for the current time and the 5 day forecast.
